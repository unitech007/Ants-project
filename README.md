# Ants
### What is Ants ?
A platform for all the small-scale vendors, housewives and any other skilled people who are not getting enough time to showcase their skills due to many different reasons like less market knowledge, less awareness of how to target the customers, and because of large-scale companies who have acquired the market. Our platform will help such skilled people to expand their businesses under their brand name and customers can afford their services at a reasonable cost.

## MVC

MVC is an acronym for Model-View-Controller.

**Model:** Model represents the structure of data, the format and the constraints with which it is stored. It maintains the data of the application. Essentially, it is the database part of the application.

**View:** View is what is presented to the user. Views utilize the Model and present data in a form in which the user wants. A user can also be allowed to make changes to the data presented to the user. They consist of static and dynamic pages which are rendered or sent to the user when the user requests them.

**Controller:** Controller controls the requests of the user and then generates appropriate response which is fed to the viewer. Typically, the user interacts with the View, which in turn generates the appropriate request, this request will be handled by a controller. The controller renders the appropriate view with the model data as a response.

So, to sum it up:

Model is data part.<br/>
View is User Interface part.<br/>
Controller is request-response handler.<br/>

As you can see, there is a **routes** folder, which will serve as **controllers**.<br/>
Then there is a **models** folder, in which we have a different models.<br/>
A **views** folder, which have our views with an extension of ejs. Be noted that ejs is a templating engine which means that it has the ability to generate the pages by filling in the templating that we create.<br/>
A **middleware** folder, which have our middlewares for authentication and to check comment ownership.<br/>
